              <h2>Hello.</h2>
              <p class="intro">I am a recent college graduate from the University of Massachusetts Lowell, 
                looking to begin my career in the field of computer science by securing 
                an entry-level job within the field. I am primarily looking for software 
                engineer, software developer, or web developer positions. I have experience creating software with 
                C, C++, C#, Python, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, MYSQL, and JS.

                <h3>Design and Development</h3>
                <p>I started learning how to program because I wanted to be able to create my own games and share them with friends. I have since 
                    found my passion in developing software of all kinds, especially when I get to learn new methods or skills. And have a recent
                    passion in Web Development and Design.</p>

                <h3>C, C++, C#</h3>
                <p>While I love using and learning all kinds of programming languages, I believe my strongest and favorites are those in 
                    the C family. I use C# frequently in game dev/design and pracitce C and C++ on LeetCode to keep my skills sharp with them even
                    when not working on specific projects.</p>

              <a class="projLink"href="https://handodoom.itch.io/dragon-dice">Dragon Dice</a>
              <p>A Game created by myself and a partner, HandODoom, for the recent GMTK 2022 Game Jam. The theme of this Game Jam
                was "Roll of the Dice" which led us to creating a pokemon battle stlye game based on literal dice rolls. I specifically 
                contributed to the enemy behavior, the systems for death of player/enemies (functionality + needed UI elements), the enemy spawn
                pattern/boss mechanics, as well as many smaller details when needed.
